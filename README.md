# Linear Regression Model for Housing Data

This repository contains a **Linear Regression** model that predicts housing prices based on various features from the dataset `housing.csv`. The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow — from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📂 Files Included
- **`housing.csv`** — The dataset containing housing features and target prices.
- **`regression.ipynb`** — The Jupyter notebook integrating all steps:
  - Data exploration (EDA)
  - Data cleaning and standardization
  - Model training (without external regression libraries where possible)
  - Model evaluation using **R² score**
  - Visualization of predictions vs actual values

## 🚀 What the Model Does
- Reads and processes the housing dataset.
- Standardizes features to ensure consistent scaling.
- Trains a linear regression model to learn relationships between features and housing prices.
- Evaluates model performance using the **R² score**.
- Produces predictions and plots for visual analysis.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KazimRaza010/Linear-Regression-Model-for-Housing-Data.git
   cd Linear-Regression-Model-for-Housing-Data
